## Mod description

This mod displays whether or not your forks (or other implements) are level (= horizontal orientation) or not.

If the tool is tilted down too much, an upwards arrow will appear, if it is tilted up too much, a downwards arrow will appear.

The icon is displayed in at the bottom-left of the speed dial by default but can be moved through the general settings page.

The mod works for at least any base game front loader tool, wheel loader tool, telehandler tool, skid steer tool and forklift.
Note that the "level" orientation depends on how the tool was designed.
