## Mod description

This mod displays whether or not your forks (or other implements) are level (= horizontal orientation) or not.

You can choose between icons or degrees in the settings, you can turn on or off color coding if set to "degrees", and you can move the display around, if needed.

The mod works for at least any base game front loader tool, wheel loader tool, telehandler tool, skid steer tool and forklift.
Note that the "level" orientation depends on how the tool was designed.
